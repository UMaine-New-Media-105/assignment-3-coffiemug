create a sprite, I made a dog, for your game which follows the x position of your mouse, and will eventually catch other sprites as they fall from the top of the screen.

add a mouseIsPressed() function so that something on your catcher sprite changes when you click. this will eventually be the change that occurs when the falling sprite is caught. my puppy now says woof when the mouse is pressed.

A3Q3

add a falling object which your sprite will eventually try to catch. let the falling object, here it's a bone, fall from a new random x position each time the sketch is played.
